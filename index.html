                    By the end of this post, you'll know what makes some of today's best "About Us" and "About Me" pages so great, and how to make your own about page that shares your company's greatness.When you have a great story about how your product or service was built
                    to change lives, share it. The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing context and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more

                    sections that combine words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture instead of big chunks of text. They're clear about why they're different: "Not a Charity," the page reads. And then: "This is the basis for a brighter future,
                    built on a hand up, not a handout."
